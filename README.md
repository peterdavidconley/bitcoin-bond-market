# bitcoin-bond-market

This is an application that publishes live data of bitcoin bond offerings across the market. Think of a stock market tracker, but instead it tracks bitcoin bond offerings across different companies.

## Motivation

As the crypto economy and ecosystem grows we will start to see companies and applications meet the same needs or services of the traditional market. For example, there are already plenty of "stock market trackers" in the crypto economy. They are companies like [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) that list and publish the prices and market cap of most cryptocurrencies.

## Design

A mock design can be found here: [Canva Design Link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAE8cbDH7Co/qwqVKXQ48lUYaL3tTu5WLA/view?website#2)

## Project Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## How to Use

Build out a basic React application with major components to interact with the API. The components should render, in real time, the bond data (LTV, Yield, etc.) and the party offering the bond.
